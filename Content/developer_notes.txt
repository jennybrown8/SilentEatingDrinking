To test when the event triggers, you can respawn yourself using the implant or use the command `editorreconnect`.

SaveGameActor_BP_SilentEatingDrinking is what applies the buff to the player on character spawn.

The buff itself, and all item silencing code, is in Buff_SilentEatingDrinking.  It looks up the Instigator of the buff (which is the player character), finds the inventory from there, and scans it for PrimalItemConsumableEatable items, and for each one, it nulls out their use sound and their use animation.

PrimalItemConsumable_Eatable has a property "Play Animation on Use" that points to Human-Eat_Montage.  Need to disable that to silence some sounds.

PrimalItemCustomFoodRecipe_Base skips the montage and plays "Use Item Sound" instead.  Need to null that out to silence the other sounds.

PrimalItemConsumableRespecSoup also uses Use Item Sound.
